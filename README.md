# MHCepitopes database
Our database catalogues **451,065** MHC peptide epitopes, each with experimental evidence for MHC binding, along with detailed information on HLA allele specificity, source peptides, and references to original studies. We also provide the grand average of hydropathy scores and predicted immunogenicity for the epitopes.

# Selected data from the database (MHCepitopes) has been made available on the web and can be accessed at https://c2acs761.caspio.com/dp/3c01b00082e291b8cb0146e4b49a
